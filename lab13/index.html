	<h1>Lab 13: Loops</h1>

	<hr>

	<div class = "bodyParagraphs">

		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>For this lab, we need to use loop to do something repeatly.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>Task 1 to task 3 were pretty easy. While working on task X, it took me some time to figuring out how to do the same thing as shown in the example screenshot.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>After making some experiments, I figured out how to do these thing by myself. However, I felt my code was not very efficient and could be improved. Maybe I would refactor my code in the future. </p>

			<div id = "outputSetting">
				<h3> Input Settings</h3>

				<p>How many loops do you want? <input type = 'text' id = "loopNum"></p>
			</div>

			<button id = "setButton">Click to add input pairs</button>

			<button id = "runButton">Click to see the result</button>
