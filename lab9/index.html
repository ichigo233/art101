		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>I had some challenges while doing taskX. I chose to answer the first question and searched many methods on how to add an element on the top of other element.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>After some experiemnts, I figured out how to use insertBefore method to move element on the top of other elements.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>You can see the result below. I created a button as the triiger of a function. The function will take the last child from the second list to the first list as its first child.</p>

		<div id = "outputBlock">
			<h2>Script Output</h2>
			<div id = "output"></div>
			<button type = "button" id = "button">Click me to do something!</button>
