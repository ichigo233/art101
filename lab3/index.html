		<h1>Lab 3 File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
		<h2>Main Subject</h2>
		<p>The main point of this lab was to create a local file structure and how to organize or edit the strucutre as we needed.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>Although it was not hard to create a clear file strucutre, it took me a lot of effort trying to create a navbar at the main page.</p>

		<h2>Result</h2>
		<p>After checking w3school for how to make a navbar, the navbar works properly on my homepage. I think the navbar is not good enough and I'll continue to work on it.</p>
