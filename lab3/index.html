		<h1>Lab 3 File Structure</h1>
		<p>The main point of this lab was to create a local file structure and how to organize or edit the strucutre as we needed.

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>Although it was not hard to create a clear file strucutre, it took me a lot of effort trying to create a navbar at the main page. The navbar still had some minor issues that needed to be fixed like the buttom-border for the last-child.
