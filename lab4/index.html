	<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>

	<hr>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>Trying to figure out an everyday task with pseudocoding is pretty diffcult because I need to keep each step high-level, which was not very intuitive for me.</p>

	<h2>Problems</h2>

	<h2>Result</h2>

	<h3>Outline of task 2</h3>
	<pre><code>
	//Making a minesweeper game

	//Set the number of mines, columns, and rows
	//Loop through all columns to create grids (randomly distribute mines)
		//Loop through all rows to create grids
	//While the winning or losing condition is not fulfilled
		//Player flip or put a flag on a unflipped grid
		//Show the result of the input
		//Check if the new input fulfills winning or losing condition
			//If input fulfills any condition, the game ends
			//Else, loop back to accept player input
	</pre></code>
