	<h1>Lab 14: Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>

	<hr>

	<div class = "bodyParagraphs">

		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>For this lab, we need to debug the past lab with the debugging tools and strategies.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I didn't run into any problem this time becasue I already learnt about these debugging tools or strategies while learning Unity and C# before this class.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Because I did all the labs with these debugging strategies, so I chose to debug the functions I did for the team project. As the screenshots and descriptions shown below, I picked out the function that worked properly by using console.log() and the comment in Atom.</p>

			<img class="images" src="img/image4.png"/>
			<img class="images" src="img/image5.png"/>

			<br>

			<p>The first screenshot shows the result of the test functions I did for our team project by using "console.log()".<br>
			In Atom, I used two approaches to do the same thing and making experiments which could do what I want by commenting out another one.<br>
			Finally, it turned out that the first approach couldn't work properly. The third screenshot was the result of my function after debugging, which did exactly what I want.
