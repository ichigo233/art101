	<div class = "bodyParagraphs">

		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>For this lab, we need to use json as url to practice using APIs to fetch data from the internet.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>This lab itself was not very hard. The only trouble I ran into was that I forgot how to solve the CORS issue. Fortunatelly, my problem was solved after I asked on Discord.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>As the output div shows, my code works properly. I also figured out how to add previous and next button!</p>

	</div>

	<h2>Output</h2>

	<div id = "output">
		<div id = "outputBlock">
		</div>
		<button id = "previousButton">Previous</button>
		<button id = "nextButton">Next</button>
	</div>
