			<p>The reqired tasks were not hard to do, so I tried to add more functions that I learnt from W3school by linking the JavaScript to the HTML.</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>While doing that, it turned out I didn't fully understand how these files were connected and the functions didn't show up and work.</p>

			<h2>Result</h2>
			<p>At last, I deleted the codes that didn't work properly. I only left the basic reqired code on my web, but it was fun to try out new things by doing experiment with them.</p>

			<h2>Script Output</h2>
			<div id = "outputBlock">
				<script type = "text/javascript" src = "js/lab.js">
