			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>The process of this lab was smooth.</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>The only problem I had is that my JavaScript didn't work and show up when I first tested my HTML locally.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>I found out it was because the code from the example image for this lab had some minor issues. For example, the semicolon of the "myMainRide" object was in the wrong position.</p>
