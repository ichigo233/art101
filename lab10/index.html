		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>For this lab, we need to get the user input, restore it and use it as a parameter for other functions.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>Task 1 to task 3 were not hard. Task X took me a lot of effort to figure out how to make the button work properly since there were different conditions regarding user input.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>As the input fields below, the function worked properly and it would change the innerHTML based on user input.</p>

		<div id = "outputBlock">
			<h2>Script Output</h2>

			<lable for = "inputField">Input your name:
				<input type = "text" id = "user-name">
				<button id="inputButton">Get your name</button>
			</label>

			<br><br>

			<lable for = "inputField">Add something to the output div:<br>
				<input type = "text" class = "extraInput"><br>
				<input type = "text" class = "extraInput"><br>
				<input type = "text" class = "extraInput"><br>
				<input type = "text" class = "extraInput"><br>
				<button id="extraButton">Let's add it</button>
			</label>

			<div id = "output"></div>
