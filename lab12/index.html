		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>For this lab, we needed to write a function that returned different results based on different input/conditions.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>Writing the function for task 1 to task 3 and doing refactoring for the bonus part were not hard. The only problem I had was about jQuery. When I tested my code locally, I found that using the selector $("#userName") only returned undefined rather than actual user name.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>Finally I realized it was because the selector in jQuery would always returned an array. So I fixed the problem by adding index to the selector. As you can see, now the code works properly.</p>

		<div id = "outputBlock">
			<h2>Script Output</h2>
			<h3>Prepare To Be Sorted Into Your House</h3>

			<p>It's the time to enter your name: </p>
			<input type = "text" id = "input">
			<button id = "button">Submit Name</button>

			<div id = "output"></div>
		</div>
