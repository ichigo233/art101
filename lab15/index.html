	<h1>Lab 15: AJAX</h1>

	<div class = "bodyParagraphs">

		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>For this lab, we need to use APIs to get data from the internet.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The tasks for this lab were not very hard, including task X. However, this process was not hard as long as the API I chose had clear documentation and not very complicated to uese.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>As the screenshots showed, I used two buttons for two different APIs that both worked properly.</p>
