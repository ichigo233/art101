		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>This lab was finished smoothly and I didn't encounter any huge problems. Maybe it was because I had experience with C# which was similar to javascript in many ways. </p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I didn't have any problem with this lab. What I did for task X took me more time than other tasks because I needed to figure out a function using callback.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>As they displayed in the output section, all the results are properly displayed.</p>
